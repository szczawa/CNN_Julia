## Basic Theory

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are specialized neural networks particularly effective for image-related tasks. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. Key concepts in CNNs include:

- **Convolution Layers**: Apply filters (kernels) across the image to detect various features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
- **Pooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps to reduce spatial dimensions, which helps in lowering computational complexity and capturing important patterns.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Often used towards the end of the network to combine all learned features for final classification.

### Training Process

Training a CNN involves several steps:

1. **Forward Pass**: Input images pass through the network, layer by layer, to produce predictions.
2. **Loss Calculation**: The difference between predictions and actual labels is calculated, typically using a loss function like cross-entropy.
3. **Backpropagation**: The loss is propagated backward through the network, adjusting weights to minimize errors.
4. **Optimization**: Techniques like gradient descent are used to update weights iteratively, improving the modelâ€™s accuracy.

CNNs learn through numerous training epochs, where they iteratively adjust weights to minimize errors. This training process enables CNNs to generalize and classify unseen data accurately.
